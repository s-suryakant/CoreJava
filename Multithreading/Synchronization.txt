Q1: What is synchronized keyword & where we can apply?
    >> synchronized is a modifier applicable for methods & blocks.
    >> With the help of a synchronized modifier, we can restrict a shared resource to be accessed only by one thread.

Q2: Explain advantage of synchronized keyword?
    >> we can resolve data inconsistency problems

Q3: Explain disadvantage of synchronized keyword?
    >> it increases waiting time of threads & creates performance problems

Q4: What is race condition?
    >> If multiple threads are operating simultaneously on same java object then there maybe a chance of data inconsistency problem.
       This is called race condition. We can overcome this problem using synchronized keyword.

Q5: What is object lock & when it is required?
    >> An object-level lock is a mechanism when we want to synchronize a non-static method or non-static code block such that only
       one thread will be able to execute the code block on a given instance of the class.

Q6: What is class level lock & when it is required?
    >> Class level lock prevents multiple threads to enter a synchronized block in any of all available instances of the class on runtime.

Q7: Class level lock VS Object lock
    >> When a thread wants to execute static synchronized method class level lock is required.
       When a wants to execute instance synchronized method then object level lock is required.

    >> Object-level locking helps control access to individual items, while class-level locking oversees shared resources.

Q8: While a thread is executing synchronized method on given object are remaining threads allowed to execute any other synchronized
    method simultaneously on the same object?
    >> No

Q9: What is synchronized block?
    >> Synchronized block is used to prevent multiple threads from executing a portion of a code in a method at the same point in time.

Q10: How to declare synchronized block to get lock of:
     Current Object: synchronized(this){    }
     Specific Object: synchronized(obj){    }
     class level lock: synchronized(ClassName.class){  }

Q11: Advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method?
    >> it reduces the waiting time of threads hence improving performance.

Q12: Can a thread acquire multiple locks simultaneously?
    >> Yes
    >> From different objects multiple locks can be acquired

Q13: What is synchronized statement? (Interview people created terminology)
    >> The statements present in synchronized method & synchronized block are called synchronized statements.
