** ThreadGroup:
>>  ThreadGroup thread = new ThreadGroup(String name)
    > Creates a new thread group with  specified group name.
    > Parent of this thread group is the thread group of currently executing thread.
>>  ThreadGroup thread = new ThreadGroup(Thread pg, String name)
    > Creates a new thread group with  specified group name.
    > Parent is the specified parent group "pg".

** ReentrantLock:
>>  ReentrantLock l = new ReentrantLock();
    > Creates an instance of ReentrantLock.
>>  ReentrantLock l = new ReentrantLock(boolean fairness);
    > Creates an instance of ReentrantLock with the given fairness policy.
    > if fairness = true then longest waiting thread can acquire the lock if it is available(First Come First Serve).
    > if fairness = false them which waiting thread will get chance we can't expect.
    > fairness default value is false.

** ThreadLocal:
>>  ThreadLocal tl - new ThreadLocal();
    > Creates a new ThreadLocal variable.

** InheritableThreadLocal:
>>  InheritableThreadLocal tl = new InheritableThreadLocal();
    > Child class of ThreadLocal & hence all methods present in ThreadLocal by default available to InheritableThreadLocal.
