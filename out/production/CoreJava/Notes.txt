**  Syntax for Method Reference:
    >>  Static methods
        ClassName :: methodName
    >>  Instance methods
        ObjectReference :: methodName

> Alternative to lambda expression.
> Code reusability.
> Argument types must be same for referring.

**  Constructor Reference:
    >>  ClassName :: new
